# Application Onboarding workflow
The application onboarding workflow is a workflow that demonstrates the following features of the serverless workflow technology:
* Integration with external service, in this case, Jira Cloud via its OpenAPI
* Callback events
* Timeout of a workflow
* Conditional branching
* Using the Notifications plugin to send notifications to the user

The workflow creates a Jira issue and waits for its completion within 30s.
After creating the Jira issue, the workflow sends a notification to the default user to be aware of the issue.
If the Jira is resolved within 30 seconds, the workflow sends a notification that the issue is resolved.
If the Jira issue isn't resolved within 30 seconds, the workflow closes it and sends a notification the workflow was closed due to a timeout.

This workflow can be extended to introduce more capabilities, such as creating a Namespace in OpenShift cluster for the user and deploying a given application to that namespace. This is excluded from the current workflow for simplifying it.

## Prerequisite
The workflow expects a Jira webhook to exist and notify the Backstage about events for issues:
* Create a webhook( see `https://<jira_url>/plugins/servlet/webhooks`) in your JIRA for *ISSUE* events that point to `<BACKSTAGE_URL>/api/orchestrator/webhook/jira`.
Please note that this endpoint has been created for demo purposes so it is not generic enough to support multiple use cases. This step can be skipped if you are willing to send the cloud event yourself.
* Be sure the workflow schema is set to classic in Jira: `https://<jira_url>/plugins/servlet/project-config/<project key>/workflows`

## Input
- `Jira Project Key` [required] - the Jira Project Key to which the workflow is configured to work and has permission to create and update and issue of type Task.
