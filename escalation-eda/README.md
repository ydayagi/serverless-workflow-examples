# Escalation workflow with Event Driven Architecture
## Use case
As a user I want to create a ticket to request the creation of a new namespace in an OpenShift cluster and inform the given
escalation manager in case the ticket is not completed in a given time.

Working assumptions:
* Jira is the ticketing system
* The escalation manager is notified with an email from an external mailing service
* The application is deployed as a serverless workload in OpenShift using Helm charts
* The user workflow is implemented using the SonataFlow platform

## Architectural components
![Escalation architecture][1]

## Jira server
A ticketing service configured to create tickets and notify webhooks any time the tickets are updated.

# Escalation workflow
A Serverless Workflow receiving the user request and then creating the ticket: once it is approved, it take care of provisioning the given namespace.

See the [README][2]

### Jira listener
A Java application configured to receive webhooks from the ticketing service, extract the relevant data and notify the Escalation workflow about the approval.

See the [README][3]

### Serverless infrastructure
It is made of the following components:
* `Red Hat Serverless Operator`, and basic `KnativeEventing` and `KnativeServing` instances
* An in-memory `Broker` receiving `CloudEvent`s from the `Jira listener` (linked using a  `SinkBinding` instance) to the `Escalation workflow` 
  (using a `Trigger` instance)

## Deploying the example
This is a two steps deployment:
1. [Deploy the serverless infrastrucure](#eda-infra-chart) (optional, if already availble)
2. [Deploy the escalation services](#escalation-eda-chart)

### eda-infra chart
The [eda-infra][4] Helm creates the `Red Hat Serverless Operator`, and default instances of `KnativeEventing` and `KnativeServing`.
This chart requires a user with `cluster-admin` role.

**Note**: as an alternative, you can provision the same resources manually, using the OpenShift UI console or the `oc` CLI command.

It also created the needed [CRDs][5] according to the latest release of the
[OpenShift Serverless 1.30 operator](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_serverless/1.30/html-single/about_serverless/index#new-features-1-30-0_serverless-release-notes).

CRDs were downloaded from:
```bash
curl -LJO https://github.com/knative/operator/releases/download/knative-v1.9.6/operator.yaml
```

The following commands install, upgrade and delete the [eda-infra][6]
Helm chart in the `default` namespace with name `eda-infra`:
```bash
helm install -n default eda-infra helm/eda-infra --debug
helm status -n default eda-infra
helm upgrade -n default eda-infra helm/eda-infra --debug
helm uninstall -n default eda-infra --debug
```

After the initial installation, run the following commands to wait until the serverless infrastructure is ready:
```bash
> oc wait -n knative-eventing knativeeventing/knative-eventing --for=condition=Ready --timeout=5m          
knativeeventing.operator.knative.dev/knative-eventing condition met
> oc wait -n knative-serving knativeserving/knative-serving --for=condition=Ready --timeout=5m
knativeserving.operator.knative.dev/knative-serving condition met
```

**Note**: the CRDs are not removed when the chart is uninstalled, see the [Helm docs](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/custom_resource_definitions/#some-caveats-and-explanations)

**Know issues**: after the uninstall command the KnativeEventing and KnativeServing instances can remain in terminating state, which also prevents the 
associated namespaces from being deleted. Manually run this command to verify the status:
```bash
oc get knativeeventing,knativeserving --all-namespaces
```
Then run this command to patch the instances so that they can be eventually deleted:
```bash
oc patch -n knative-eventing knativeeventing/knative-eventing -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":null}}' --type=merge
oc patch -n knative-serving knativeserving/knative-serving -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":null}}' --type=merge
```

### escalation-eda chart
The [escalation-eda][7] Helm creates all the services related to the deployment of the [Escalation workflow](#escalation-workflow) 
and the [Jira listener](#jira-listener).

This chart requires a user with `admin` role.

Helm properties:

| Property | Description | Mandatory | Default |
|----------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| `namespace.create` | Flag to create the target namespace | ❌ | `true` |
| `namespace.name` | Target namespace name | ❌ | `escalation` |
| `jiralistener.image` | Container image of the `Jira listener` application | ❌ | `quay.io/orchestrator/jira-listener-jvm` |
| `jiralistener.name` | The name of the `Jira listener` service [see Troubleshooting the Duplicate Certificate Limit error][8] | ❌ | `jira-listener` |
| `escalationSwf.name` | The name of te `Escalation SWF` service | ❌ | `escalation-swf` |
| `escalationSwf.image` | Container image of the `Escalation SWF` application | ❌ | `quay.io/orchestrator/escalation-swf:1.0` |
| `escalationSwf.jira.url` | The Jira server URL | ✅ | |
| `escalationSwf.jira.username` | The Jira server username | ✅ | |
| `escalationSwf.jira.apiToken` | The Jira API Token | ✅ | |
| `escalationSwf.jira.project` | The key of the Jira project where the escalation issue is created | ✅ | |
| `escalationSwf.jira.issueType` | The ID of the Jira issue type to be created | ✅ | |
| `escalationSwf.mailTrap.apiToken` | The MailTrail API Token | ✅ | |
| `escalationSwf.mailTrap.inboxId` | The ID of the MailTrap inbox | ✅ | |
| `escalationSwf.ocp.apiServerUrl` | The OpenShift API server URL | ✅ | |
| `escalationSwf.ocp.apiServerToken` | The OpenShift API server token | ✅ | |
| `escalationSwf.escalationTimeoutSeconds` | The time to wait (in seconds) before escalating | ❌ | `30` |
| `eventdisplay.enabled` | Flag to install the optional `event-display` application for debugging purposes | ❌ | `true` |
| `letsEncryptCertificate` | Flag to use the `Lets Encrypt` certificate to expose the `Jira listener` service as the webhook receiver | ❌ | `false` |

The following commands install, upgrade and delete the [escalation-eda][7] Helm chart in the `default` namespace
 with name `escalation-eda`, assuming you provided the mandatory values in a file `escalation-eda-values.yaml`:
```bash
helm install -n default escalation-eda helm/escalation-eda --debug -f ./escalation-eda-values.yaml
helm status -n default escalation-eda
helm upgrade -n default escalation-eda helm/escalation-eda --debug -f ./escalation-eda-values.yaml
helm uninstall -n default escalation-eda --debug
```

After the initial installation, run the following commands to wait until the services are ready:
```bash
> oc wait -n escalation ksvc -l app=jira-listener --for=condition=Ready --timeout=5m
service.serving.knative.dev/jira-listener condition met
> oc wait -n escalation ksvc -l app=escalation-swf --for=condition=Ready --timeout=5m
service.serving.knative.dev/escalation-swf condition met
```

#### Deploy using the Let's Encrypt certificate
To uses the publicly-signed TLS certificate from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), set the following values in the custom values file:
```yaml
letsEncryptCertificate: false
jiralistener:
  name: _YOUR_CUSTOM_NAME_
```

#### Deploying on OpenShift sandbox
When deploying on the [OpenShift sandbox](https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox), remember to manage the Helm chart in the user namespace, not in the `default` one:
```bash
SANDBOX_NS=$(oc project -q)
```

Then, set the following values in the custom values file:
```bash
namespace: 
  create: false
  name: <value of $SANDBOX_NS>
```
